# Building a Research Paper Assistant with RAG

In this guide, we'll create an AI research assistant that can analyze academic papers and answer specific questions about their content using Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG).

We'll use the foundational Transformer paper [Attention Is All You Need](https://arxiv.org/html/1706.03762) as our example.

## Understanding RAG Components

Let's understand how RAG works and how we'll implement each component:

1. Knowledge Store/Index
   - Converting text into vector representations
   - Creating numerical representations of content
   - Implementation: We'll use OpenAI's text-embedding-3-small to create embeddings and store them in PgVector

2. Retriever
   - Finding relevant content via similarity search
   - Matching query embeddings with stored vectors
   - Implementation: We'll use PgVector to perform similarity searches on our stored embeddings

3. Generator
   - Processing retrieved content with an LLM
   - Creating contextually informed responses
   - Implementation: We'll use GPT-4o-mini to generate answers based on retrieved content

Our implementation will:
1. Process the Transformer paper into embeddings
2. Store them in PgVector for quick retrieval
3. Use similarity search to find relevant sections
4. Generate accurate responses using retrieved context

<Steps>
### Initialize Project and Install Dependencies

First, create a new directory for your project and navigate into it:

```bash
mkdir research-assistant
cd research-assistant
```

Initialize a new Node.js project and install the required dependencies:

```bash
npm init -y
npm install @mastra/core @mastra/rag @mastra/pg @ai-sdk/openai ai zod
```

Set up environment variables for API access and database connection:

```bash filename=".env" copy
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
POSTGRES_CONNECTION_STRING=your_connection_string
```

Create the necessary files for our project:

```bash copy
mkdir -p src/mastra/agents
touch src/mastra/agents/researchAgent.ts
touch src/mastra/index.ts src/store.ts src/index.ts
```

### Create the Research Assistant Agent

Now we'll create our RAG-enabled research assistant. The agent uses:
- A [Vector Query Tool](/reference/tools/vector-query-tool) for performing semantic search over our vector store to find relevant content in our papers.
- GPT-4o-mini for understanding queries and generating responses
- Custom instructions that guide the agent on how to analyze papers, use retrieved content effectively, and acknowledge limitations

```ts copy showLineNumbers filename="src/mastra/agents/researchAgent.ts"
import { Agent } from '@mastra/core/agent';
import { openai } from '@ai-sdk/openai';
import { createVectorQueryTool } from '@mastra/rag';

// Create a tool for semantic search over our paper embeddings
const vectorQueryTool = createVectorQueryTool({
  vectorStoreName: 'pgVector',
  indexName: 'papers',
  model: openai.embedding('text-embedding-3-small'),
});

export const researchAgent = new Agent({
  name: 'Research Assistant',
  instructions: 
    `You are a helpful research assistant that analyzes academic papers and technical documents.
    Use the provided vector query tool to find relevant information from your knowledge base, 
    and provide accurate, well-supported answers based on the retrieved content.
    Focus on the specific content available in the tool and acknowledge if you cannot find sufficient information to answer a question.
    Base your responses only on the content provided, not on general knowledge.`,
  model: openai('gpt-4o-mini'),
  tools: {
    vectorQueryTool,
  },
});
```

### Set Up the Mastra Instance and Vector Store

```ts copy showLineNumbers filename="src/mastra/index.ts"
import { Mastra } from '@mastra/core';
import { PgVector } from '@mastra/pg';

import { researchAgent } from './agents/researchAgent';

// Initialize Mastra instance
const pgVector = new PgVector(process.env.POSTGRES_CONNECTION_STRING!);
export const mastra = new Mastra({
  agents: { researchAgent },
  vectors: { pgVector },
});
```

### Load and Process the Paper

This step handles the initial document processing. We:
1. Fetch the research paper from its URL
2. Convert it into a document object
3. Split it into smaller, manageable chunks for better processing

```ts copy showLineNumbers filename="src/store.ts"
import { openai } from "@ai-sdk/openai";
import { MDocument } from '@mastra/rag';
import { embedMany } from 'ai';
import { mastra } from "./mastra";

// Load the paper
const paperUrl = "https://arxiv.org/html/1706.03762";
const response = await fetch(paperUrl);
const paperText = await response.text();

// Create document and chunk it
const doc = MDocument.fromText(paperText);
const chunks = await doc.chunk({
  strategy: 'recursive',
  size: 512,
  overlap: 50,
  separator: '\n',
});

console.log("Number of chunks:", chunks.length);
// Number of chunks: 893
```

### Create and Store Embeddings

Finally, we'll prepare our content for RAG by:
1. Generating embeddings for each chunk of text
2. Creating a vector store index to hold our embeddings
3. Storing both the embeddings and metadata (original text and source information) in our vector database

> **Note**: This metadata is crucial as it allows us to return the actual content when the vector store finds relevant matches.

This allows our agent to efficiently search and retrieve relevant information.

```ts copy showLineNumbers{23} filename="src/store.ts"
// Generate embeddings
const { embeddings } = await embedMany({
  model: openai.embedding('text-embedding-3-small'),
  values: chunks.map(chunk => chunk.text),
});

// Get the vector store instance from Mastra
const vectorStore = mastra.getVector('pgVector');

// Create an index for our paper chunks
await vectorStore.createIndex({
  indexName: 'papers',
  dimension: 1536,
});

// Store embeddings
await vectorStore.upsert({
  indexName: 'papers',
  vectors: embeddings,
  metadata: chunks.map(chunk => ({
    text: chunk.text,
    source: 'transformer-paper'
  })),
});
```

This will:
1. Load the paper from the URL
2. Split it into manageable chunks
3. Generate embeddings for each chunk
4. Store both the embeddings and text in our vector database

To run the script and store the embeddings:

```bash
npx bun src/store.ts
```

### Test the Assistant

Let's test our research assistant with different types of queries:

```ts filename="src/index.ts" showLineNumbers copy
import { mastra } from "./mastra";
const agent = mastra.getAgent('researchAgent');

// Basic query about concepts
const query1 = "What problems does sequence modeling face with neural networks?";
const response1 = await agent.generate(query1);
console.log("\nQuery:", query1);
console.log("Response:", response1.text);
```

Run the script:

```bash copy
npx bun src/index.ts
```

You should see output like:
```
Query: What problems does sequence modeling face with neural networks?
Response: Sequence modeling with neural networks faces several key challenges:
1. Vanishing and exploding gradients during training, especially with long sequences
2. Difficulty handling long-term dependencies in the input
3. Limited computational efficiency due to sequential processing
4. Challenges in parallelizing computations, resulting in longer training times
```

Let's try another question:
```ts filename="src/index.ts" showLineNumbers{10} copy
// Query about specific findings
const query2 = "What improvements were achieved in translation quality?";
const response2 = await agent.generate(query2);
console.log("\nQuery:", query2);
console.log("Response:", response2.text);
```

Output:
```
Query: What improvements were achieved in translation quality?
Response: The model showed significant improvements in translation quality, achieving more than 2.0 
BLEU points improvement over previously reported models on the WMT 2014 English-to-German translation 
task, while also reducing training costs.
```

### Serve the Application

Start the Mastra server to expose your research assistant via API:

```bash
mastra dev
```

Your research assistant will be available at:
```
http://localhost:4111/api/agents/researchAgent/generate
```

Test with curl:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:4111/api/agents/researchAgent/generate \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "messages": [
      { "role": "user", "content": "What were the main findings about model parallelization?" }
    ]
  }'
```
