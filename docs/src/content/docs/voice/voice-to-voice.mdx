# Voice-to-Voice Capabilities in Mastra

## Introduction

Voice-to-Voice in Mastra provides a standardized interface for real-time speech-to-speech interactions across multiple service providers. This section covers configuration, event-driven architecture, and implementation methods for creating conversational voice experiences. For integrating Voice-to-Voice capabilities with agents, refer to the [Adding Voice to Agents](../agents/adding-voice.mdx) documentation.

## Real-time Voice Interactions

Mastra's real-time voice system enables continuous bidirectional audio communication through an event-driven architecture. Unlike separate TTS and STT operations, real-time voice maintains an open connection that processes speech continuously in both directions.

### Example Implementation

```typescript
import { Agent } from "@mastra/core/agent";
import { OpenAIRealtimeVoice } from "@mastra/voice-openai-realtime";

const agent = new Agent({
  name: 'Agent',
  instructions: `You are a helpful assistant with real-time voice capabilities.`,
  model: openai('gpt-4o'),
  voice: new OpenAIRealtimeVoice(),
});

// Connect to the voice service
await agent.voice.connect();

// Listen for agent audio responses
agent.voice.on('speaking', ({ audio }) => {
  playAudio(audio);
});

// Initiate the conversation
await agent.voice.speak('How can I help you today?');

// Send continuous audio from the microphone
const micStream = getMicrophoneStream();
await agent.voice.send(micStream);
```

## Event-Driven Architecture

Mastra's voice-to-voice implementation is built on an event-driven architecture. Developers register event listeners to handle incoming audio progressively, allowing for more responsive interactions than waiting for complete audio responses.


## Configuration

When initializing a voice-to-voice provider, you can provide configuration options to customize its behavior:

### Constructor Options

- **`chatModel`**: Configuration for the OpenAI realtime model.
  - **`apiKey`**: Your OpenAI API key. Falls back to the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable.
  - **`model`**: The model ID to use for real-time voice interactions (e.g., `gpt-4o-mini-realtime`).
  - **`options`**: Additional options for the realtime client, such as session configuration.

- **`speaker`**: The default voice ID for speech synthesis. This allows you to specify which voice to use for the speech output.

### Example Configuration

```typescript
const voice = new OpenAIRealtimeVoice({
  chatModel: {
    apiKey: 'your-openai-api-key',
    model: 'gpt-4o-mini-realtime',
    options: {
      sessionConfig: {
        turn_detection: {
          type: 'server_vad',
          threshold: 0.6,
          silence_duration_ms: 1200,
        },
      },
    },
  },
  speaker: 'alloy', // Default voice
});

// If using default settings the configuration can be simplified to:
const voice = new OpenAIRealtimeVoice();
```

## Core Methods

The `OpenAIRealtimeVoice` class provides the following core methods for voice interactions:

### connect()

Establishes a connection to the OpenAI realtime service.

**Usage:**
```typescript
await voice.connect();
```

**Notes:**
- Must be called before using any other interaction methods
- Returns a Promise that resolves when the connection is established

### speak(text, options?)

Emits a speaking event using the configured voice model.

**Parameters:**
- `text`: String content to be spoken
- `options`: Optional configuration object
  - `speaker`: Voice ID to use (overrides default)
  - `properties`: Additional provider-specific properties

**Usage:**
```typescript
voice.speak('Hello, how can I help you today?', {
  speaker: 'alloy'
});
```

**Notes:**
- Emits 'speaker' event rather than returning an audio stream

### listen(audioInput, options?)

Processes audio input for speech recognition.

**Parameters:**
- `audioInput`: Readable stream of audio data
- `options`: Optional configuration object
  - `filetype`: Audio format (default: 'mp3')
  - Additional provider-specific options

**Usage:**
```typescript
const audioData = getMicrophoneStream();
voice.listen(audioData, {
  filetype: 'wav'
});
```

**Notes:**
- Emits 'writing' events with transcribed text

### send(audioStream)

Streams audio data in real-time for continuous processing.

**Parameters:**
- `audioStream`: Readable stream of audio data

**Usage:**
```typescript
const micStream = getMicrophoneStream();
await voice.send(micStream);
```

**Notes:**
- Used for continuous audio streaming scenarios like live microphone input
- Returns a Promise that resolves when the stream is accepted

### answer(params)

Sends a response to the OpenAI Realtime API.

**Parameters:**
- `params`: The parameters object
  - `options`: Configuration options for the response
    - `content`: Text content of the response
    - `voice`: Voice ID to use for the response

**Usage:**
```typescript
await voice.answer({
  options: {
    content: "Hello, how can I help you today?",
    voice: "alloy"
  }
});
```

**Notes:**
- Triggers a response to the real-time session
- Returns a Promise that resolves when the response has been sent

## Utility Methods

### updateConfig(config)

Updates the session configuration for the voice instance.

**Parameters:**
- `config`: New session configuration object

**Usage:**
```typescript
voice.updateConfig({
  turn_detection: {
    type: 'server_vad',
    threshold: 0.6,
    silence_duration_ms: 1200,
  }
});
```

### addTools(tools)

Adds a set of tools to the voice instance.

**Parameters:**
- `tools`: Array of tool objects that the model can call

**Usage:**
```typescript
voice.addTools([
  createTool({
    id: "Get Weather Information",
    inputSchema: z.object({
        city: z.string(),
    }),
    description: `Fetches the current weather information for a given city`,
    execute: async ({ city }) => {...},
  })
]);
```

### close()

Disconnects from the OpenAI realtime session and cleans up resources.

**Usage:**
```typescript
voice.close();
```

**Notes:**
- Should be called when you're done with the voice instance to free resources

### on(event, callback)

Registers an event listener for voice events.

**Parameters:**
- `event`: Event name ('speaker', 'writing', or 'error')
- `callback`: Function to call when the event occurs

**Usage:**
```typescript
voice.on('speaker', (stream) => {
  stream.pipe(speaker)
});
```

### off(event, callback)

Removes a previously registered event listener.

**Parameters:**
- `event`: Event name
- `callback`: The callback function to remove

**Usage:**
```typescript
voice.off('speaking', callbackFunction);
```

## Events

The `OpenAIRealtimeVoice` class emits the following events:

### speaker

Emitted when audio data is received from the model.

**Event payload:**
- `stream`: A stream of audio data as a readable stream

```typescript
agent.voice.on('speaker', (stream) => {
  stream.pipe(speaker)
});
```

### writing

Emitted when transcribed text is available.

**Event payload:**
- `text`: The transcribed text
- `role`: The role of the speaker (user or assistant)
- `done`: Boolean indicating if this is the final transcription

```typescript
agent.voice.on('writing', ({ text, role }) => {
  console.log(`${role}: ${text}`); // Log who said what
});
```

### error

Emitted when an error occurs.

**Event payload:**
- Error object with details about what went wrong

```typescript
agent.voice.on('error', (error) => {
  console.error('Voice error:', error);
});
```
