# Voice in Mastra

Mastra's Voice system provides a unified interface for voice interactions, enabling text-to-speech (TTS), speech-to-text (STT), and real-time voice-to-voice capabilities in your applications.

## Key Features

- Standardized API across different voice providers
- Support for multiple voice services
- Voice-to-voice interactions using events for continuous audio streaming
- Composable voice providers for mixing TTS and STT services

## Adding Voice to Agents

To learn how to integrate voice capabilities into your agents, check out the [Adding Voice to Agents](../agents/adding-voice.mdx) documentation. This section covers how to use both single and multiple voice providers, as well as real-time interactions.


## Example of Using a Single Voice Provider

```typescript
import { OpenAIVoice } from "@mastra/voice-openai";

// Initialize OpenAI voice for TTS
const voice = new OpenAIVoice({
  speechModel: {
    name: "tts-1-hd", // Specify the TTS model
    apiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY, // Your OpenAI API key
  },
});

// Convert text to speech
const audioStream = await voice.speak("Hello! How can I assist you today?", {
  speaker: "default", // Optional: specify a speaker
});

// Play the audio response
playAudio(audioStream);
```

## Example of Using Multiple Voice Providers
This example demonstrates how to create and use two different voice providers in Mastra: OpenAI for speech-to-text (STT) and PlayAI for text-to-speech (TTS).

Start by creating instances of the voice providers with any necessary configuration.

```typescript
import { OpenAIVoice } from "@mastra/voice-openai";
import { PlayAIVoice } from "@mastra/voice-playai";
import { CompositeVoice } from "@mastra/core/voice";

// Initialize OpenAI voice for STT
const input = new OpenAIVoice({
  listeningModel: {
    name: "whisper-1",
    apiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY,
  },
});

// Initialize PlayAI voice for TTS
const output = new PlayAIVoice({
  speechModel: {
    name: "playai-voice",
    apiKey: process.env.PLAYAI_API_KEY,
  },
});

// Combine the providers using CompositeVoice
const voice = new CompositeVoice({
  input,
  output,
});

// Implement voice interactions using the combined voice provider
const audioStream = getMicrophoneStream(); // Assume this function gets audio input
const transcript = await voice.listen(audioStream);

// Log the transcribed text
console.log("Transcribed text:", transcript);

// Convert text to speech
const responseAudio = await voice.speak(`You said: ${transcript}`, {
  speaker: "default", // Optional: specify a speaker
});

// Play the audio response
playAudio(responseAudio);
```

## Real-time Capabilities

Many voice providers support real-time speech-to-speech interactions through WebSocket connections, enabling:

- Live voice conversations with AI
- Streaming transcription
- Real-time text-to-speech synthesis
- Tool usage during conversations


## Voice Configuration

Voice providers can be configured with different models and options:

```typescript
const voice = new OpenAIVoice({
  speechModel: {
    name: "tts-1-hd",
    apiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY
  },
  listeningModel: {
    name: "whisper-1"
  },
  speaker: "alloy"
});
```
