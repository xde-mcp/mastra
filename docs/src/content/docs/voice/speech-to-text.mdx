# Speech-to-Text (STT)

Speech-to-Text (STT) in Mastra provides a standardized interface for converting audio input into text across multiple service providers. This section covers STT configuration and usage. Check out the [Adding Voice to Agents](../agents/adding-voice.mdx) documentation to learn how to use STT in an agent.

## Speech Configuration

To use STT in Mastra, you need to provide a `listeningModel` configuration when initializing the voice provider. This configuration includes parameters such as:

- **`name`**: The specific STT model to use.
- **`apiKey`**: Your API key for authentication.
- **Provider-specific options**: Additional options that may be required or supported by the specific voice provider.

**Note**: All of these parameters are optional. You can use the default settings provided by the voice provider, which will depend on the specific provider you are using.

### Example Configuration

```typescript
const voice = new OpenAIVoice({
  listeningModel: {
    name: "whisper-1",
    apiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY,
  },
});

// If using default settings the configuration can be simplified to:
const voice = new OpenAIVoice();
```

## Using the Listen Method

The primary method for STT is the `listen()` method, which converts spoken audio into text. Here's how to use it:

```typescript
const audioStream = getMicrophoneStream(); // Assume this function gets audio input
const transcript = await voice.listen(audioStream, {
  filetype: "m4a", // Optional: specify the audio file type
});
```

**Note**: If you are using a voice-to-voice provider, such as `OpenAIRealtimeVoice`, the `listen()` method will emit a "writing" event instead of returning a transcript directly.
