## Getting Started

To use workflows, first import the necessary functions from the workflows module:

```typescript
import { createWorkflow, createStep } from "@mastra/core/workflows";
import { z } from "zod"; // For schema validation
```

## Key Concepts

Workflows consist of:

- **Schemas**: Type definitions for inputs and outputs using Zod
- **Steps**: Individual units of work with defined inputs and outputs
- **Workflow**: A structured sequence of steps designed to accomplish a specific task or process. Workflows define the order, dependencies, and logic for executing steps, and can themselves be reused as steps within other workflows.
- **Workflow execution flow**: The path and logic followed during a workflow run, including how steps are executed, how data moves between them, and how conditions, branches, and errors are handled.

Schemas are defined using Zod both for inputs and outputs of steps and workflows. Schemas can also dictate what data does a step take when resuming from a suspended state, as well as what contextual information should be passed when suspending a step's execution.

The inputs and outputs of steps that are connected together should match: the inputSchema of a step should be the same as the outputSchema of the previous step, for instance. The same is true, when using workflows as steps in other workflows, the workflow's inputSchema should match the outputSchema of the step it is used as.

Steps are run using an `execute` function that receives a context object with inputs from the previous step and/or resume data if the step is being resumed from a suspended state. The `execute` function should return a value that matches its outputSchema.

Primitives such as `.then()`, `.parallel()` and `.branch()` describe the execution flow of workflows, and how the steps within them are connected. Running workflows (whether standalone or as a step), their execution is dictated by their execution flow instead of an `execute` function. The final result of a workflow will always be the result of its last step, which should match the workflow's outputSchema.

## Creating Workflows

### Steps

Steps are the building blocks of workflows. Create a step using `createStep`:

```typescript
// Create a step with defined input/output schemas and execution logic
const inputSchema = z.object({
  inputValue: z.string(),
});

const myStep = createStep({
  id: "my-step",
  description: "Does something useful",
  inputSchema,
  outputSchema: z.object({
    outputValue: z.string(),
  }),
  // Optional: Define the resume schema for step resumption
  resumeSchema: z.object({
    resumeValue: z.string(),
  }),
  // Optional: Define the suspend schema for step suspension
  suspendSchema: z.object({
    suspendValue: z.string(),
  }),
  execute: async ({
    inputData,
    mastra,
    getStepResult,
    getInitData,
    runtimeContext,
  }) => {
    const otherStepOutput = getStepResult(step2);
    const initData = getInitData<typeof inputSchema>(); // typed as the input schema variable (zod schema)
    return {
      outputValue: `Processed: ${inputData.inputValue}, ${initData.startValue} (runtimeContextValue: ${runtimeContext.get("runtimeContextValue")})`,
    };
  },
});
```

Each step requires:

- `id`: Unique identifier for the step
- `inputSchema`: Zod schema defining expected input
- `outputSchema`: Zod schema defining output shape
- `resumeSchema`: Optional. Zod schema defining resume input
- `suspendSchema`: Optional. Zod schema defining suspend input
- `execute`: Async function that performs the step's work

The `execute` function receives a context object with:

- `inputData`: The input data matching the inputSchema
- `resumeData`: The resume data matching the resumeSchema, when resuming the step from a suspended state. Only exists if the step is being resumed.
- `mastra`: Access to mastra services (agents, tools, etc.)
- `getStepResult`: Function to access results from other steps
- `getInitData`: Function to access the initial input data of the workflow in any step
- `suspend`: Function to pause workflow execution (for user interaction)

### Workflow Structure

Create a workflow using `createWorkflow`:

```typescript
// Create a workflow with defined steps and execution flow
const myWorkflow = createWorkflow({
  id: "my-workflow",
  // Define the expected input structure (should match the first step's inputSchema)
  inputSchema: z.object({
    startValue: z.string(),
  }),
  // Define the expected output structure (should match the last step's outputSchema)
  outputSchema: z.object({
    result: z.string(),
  }),
  steps: [step1, step2, step3], // Declare steps used in this workflow
})
  .then(step1)
  .then(step2)
  .then(step3)
  .commit();

// Register workflow with Mastra instance
const mastra = new Mastra({
  workflows: {
    myWorkflow,
  },
});

// Create a run instance of the workflow
const run = mastra.getWorkflow("myWorkflow").createRun();
```

The `steps` property in the workflow options provides type safety for accessing step results. When you declare the steps used in your workflow, TypeScript will ensure type safety when accessing `result.steps`:

```typescript
// With steps declared in workflow options
const workflow = createWorkflow({
  id: "my-workflow",
  inputSchema: z.object({}),
  outputSchema: z.object({}),
  steps: [step1, step2], // TypeScript knows these steps exist
})
  .then(step1)
  .then(step2)
  .commit();

const result = await workflow.createRun().start({ inputData: {} });
if (result.status === "success") {
  console.log(result.result); // only exists if status is success
} else if (result.status === "failed") {
  console.error(result.error); // only exists if status is failed, this is an instance of Error
  throw result.error;
} else if (result.status === "suspended") {
  console.log(result.suspended); // only exists if status is suspended
}

// TypeScript knows these properties exist and their types
console.log(result.steps.step1.output); // Fully typed
console.log(result.steps.step2.output); // Fully typed
```

Workflow definition requires:

- `id`: Unique identifier for the workflow
- `inputSchema`: Zod schema defining workflow input
- `outputSchema`: Zod schema defining workflow output
- `steps`: Array of steps used in the workflow (optional, but recommended for type safety)

### Re-using steps and nested workflows

You can re-use steps and nested workflows by cloning them:

```typescript
const clonedStep = cloneStep(myStep, { id: "cloned-step" });
const clonedWorkflow = cloneWorkflow(myWorkflow, { id: "cloned-workflow" });
```

This way you can use the same step or nested workflow in the same workflow multiple times.

```typescript
import {
  createWorkflow,
  createStep,
  cloneStep,
  cloneWorkflow,
} from "@mastra/core/workflows";

const myWorkflow = createWorkflow({
  id: "my-workflow",
  steps: [step1, step2, step3],
});
myWorkflow.then(step1).then(step2).then(step3).commit();

const parentWorkflow = createWorkflow({
  id: "parent-workflow",
  steps: [myWorkflow, step4],
});
parentWorkflow
  .then(myWorkflow) // nested workflow
  .then(step4)
  .then(cloneWorkflow(myWorkflow, { id: "cloned-workflow" })) // cloned workflow
  .then(cloneStep(step4, { id: "cloned-step-4" })) // cloned step
  .commit();
```

## Running Workflows

After defining a workflow, run it with:

```typescript
// Create a run instance
const run = myWorkflow.createRun();

// Start the workflow with input data
const result = await run.start({
  inputData: {
    startValue: "initial data",
  },
});

// Access the results
console.log(result.steps); // All step results
console.log(result.steps["step-id"].output); // Output from a specific step

if (result.status === "success") {
  console.log(result.result); // The final result of the workflow, result of the last step (or `.map()` output, if used as last step)
} else if (result.status === "suspended") {
  const resumeResult = await run.resume({
    step: result.suspended[0], // there is always at least one step id in the suspended array, in this case we resume the first suspended execution path
    resumeData: {
      /* user input */
    },
  });
} else if (result.status === "failed") {
  console.error(result.error); // only exists if status is failed, this is an instance of Error
}
```

**Note:** don't destructure the `run` instance
i.e. don't do
```typescript
const { start, resume, ... } = myWorkflow.createRun();

// NOR

const run = myWorkflow.createRun();
const { start, resume, ... } = run;
```
it will break the connection to the workflow and prevent it from running


## Workflow Execution Result Schema

The result of running a workflow (either from `start()` or `resume()`) follows this TypeScript interface:

```typescript
export type WorkflowResult<...> =
  | {
      status: 'success';
      result: z.infer<TOutput>;
      steps: {
        [K in keyof StepsRecord<TSteps>]: StepsRecord<TSteps>[K]['outputSchema'] extends undefined
          ? StepResult<unknown>
          : StepResult<z.infer<NonNullable<StepsRecord<TSteps>[K]['outputSchema']>>>;
      };
    }
  | {
      status: 'failed';
      steps: {
        [K in keyof StepsRecord<TSteps>]: StepsRecord<TSteps>[K]['outputSchema'] extends undefined
          ? StepResult<unknown>
          : StepResult<z.infer<NonNullable<StepsRecord<TSteps>[K]['outputSchema']>>>;
      };
      error: Error;
    }
  | {
      status: 'suspended';
      steps: {
        [K in keyof StepsRecord<TSteps>]: StepsRecord<TSteps>[K]['outputSchema'] extends undefined
          ? StepResult<unknown>
          : StepResult<z.infer<NonNullable<StepsRecord<TSteps>[K]['outputSchema']>>>;
      };
      suspended: [string[], ...string[][]];
    };
```

### Result Properties Explained

1. **status**: Indicates the final state of the workflow execution

   - `'success'`: Workflow completed successfully
   - `'failed'`: Workflow encountered an error
   - `'suspended'`: Workflow is paused waiting for user input

2. **result**: Contains the final output of the workflow, typed according to the workflow's `outputSchema`

3. **suspended**: Optional array of step IDs that are currently suspended. Only present when `status` is `'suspended'`

4. **steps**: A record containing the results of all executed steps

   - Keys are step IDs
   - Values are `StepResult` objects containing the step's output
   - Type-safe based on each step's `outputSchema`

5. **error**: Optional error object present when `status` is `'failed'`

## Watching Workflow Execution

You can also watch workflow execution:

```typescript
const run = myWorkflow.createRun();

// Add a watcher to monitor execution
run.watch(event => {
  console.log('Step completed:', event.payload.currentStep.id);
});

// Start the workflow
const result = await run.start({ inputData: {...} });
```

The `event` object has the following schema:

```typescript
type WatchEvent = {
  type: "watch";
  payload: {
    currentStep?: {
      id: string;
      status: "running" | "completed" | "failed" | "suspended";
      output?: Record<string, any>;
      payload?: Record<string, any>;
    };
    workflowState: {
      status: "running" | "success" | "failed" | "suspended";
      steps: Record<
        string,
        {
          status: "running" | "completed" | "failed" | "suspended";
          output?: Record<string, any>;
          payload?: Record<string, any>;
        }
      >;
      result?: Record<string, any>;
      error?: Record<string, any>;
      payload?: Record<string, any>;
    };
  };
  eventTimestamp: Date;
};
```

The `currentStep` property is only present when the workflow is running. When the workflow is finished the status on `workflowState` is changed, as well as the `result` and `error` properties. At the same time the `currentStep` property is removed.
