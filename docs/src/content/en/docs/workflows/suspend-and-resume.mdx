# Suspend and Resume in Workflows

Complex workflows often need to pause execution while waiting for external input or resources.

Mastra's suspend and resume features let you pause workflow execution at any step, persist the workflow snapshot to storage, and resume execution from the saved snapshot when ready.
This entire process is automatically managed by Mastra. No config needed, or manual step required from the user.

Storing the workflow snapshot to storage (LibSQL by default) means that the workflow state is permanently preserved across sessions, deployments, and server restarts. This persistence is crucial for workflows that might remain suspended for minutes, hours, or even days while waiting for external input or resources.

## When to Use Suspend/Resume

Common scenarios for suspending workflows include:

- Waiting for human approval or input
- Pausing until external API resources become available
- Collecting additional data needed for later steps
- Rate limiting or throttling expensive operations
- Handling event-driven processes with external triggers

## Basic Suspend Example

Here's a simple workflow that suspends when a value is too low and resumes when given a higher value:

```typescript
const stepTwo = new Step({
  id: "stepTwo",
  outputSchema: z.object({
    incrementedValue: z.number(),
  }),
  execute: async ({ context, suspend }) => {
    if (context.steps.stepOne.status !== "success") {
      return { incrementedValue: 0 };
    }

    const currentValue = context.steps.stepOne.output.doubledValue;

    if (currentValue < 100) {
      await suspend();
      return { incrementedValue: 0 };
    }
    return { incrementedValue: currentValue + 1 };
  },
});
```

## Async/Await Based Flow

The suspend and resume mechanism in Mastra uses an async/await pattern that makes it intuitive to implement complex workflows with suspension points. The code structure naturally reflects the execution flow.

### How It Works

1. A step's execution function receives a `suspend` function in its parameters
2. When called with `await suspend()`, the workflow pauses at that point
3. The workflow state is persisted
4. Later, the workflow can be resumed by calling `workflow.resume()` with the appropriate parameters
5. Execution continues from the point after the `suspend()` call

### Example with Multiple Suspension Points

Here's an example of a workflow with multiple steps that can suspend:

```typescript
// Define steps with suspend capability
const promptAgentStep = new Step({
  id: "promptAgent",
  execute: async ({ context, suspend }) => {
    // Some condition that determines if we need to suspend
    if (needHumanInput) {
      // Optionally pass payload data that will be stored with suspended state
      await suspend({ requestReason: "Need human input for prompt" });
      // Code after suspend() will execute when the step is resumed
      return { modelOutput: context.userInput };
    }
    return { modelOutput: "AI generated output" };
  },
  outputSchema: z.object({ modelOutput: z.string() }),
});

const improveResponseStep = new Step({
  id: "improveResponse",
  execute: async ({ context, suspend }) => {
    // Another condition for suspension
    if (needFurtherRefinement) {
      await suspend();
      return { improvedOutput: context.refinedOutput };
    }
    return { improvedOutput: "Improved output" };
  },
  outputSchema: z.object({ improvedOutput: z.string() }),
});

// Build the workflow
const workflow = new Workflow({
  name: "multi-suspend-workflow",
  triggerSchema: z.object({ input: z.string() }),
});

workflow
  .step(getUserInput)
  .then(promptAgentStep)
  .then(evaluateTone)
  .then(improveResponseStep)
  .then(evaluateImproved)
  .commit();

// Register the workflow with Mastra
export const mastra = new Mastra({
  workflows: { workflow },
});
```

### Starting and Resuming the Workflow

```typescript
// Get the workflow and create a run
const wf = mastra.getWorkflow("multi-suspend-workflow");
const run = wf.createRun();

// Start the workflow
const initialResult = await run.start({
  triggerData: { input: "initial input" },
});

let promptAgentStepResult = initialResult.activePaths.get("promptAgent");
let promptAgentResumeResult = undefined;

// Check if a step is suspended
if (promptAgentStepResult?.status === "suspended") {
  console.log("Workflow suspended at promptAgent step");

  // Resume the workflow with new context
  const resumeResult = await run.resume({
    stepId: "promptAgent",
    context: { userInput: "Human provided input" },
  });

  promptAgentResumeResult = resumeResult;
}

const improveResponseStepResult =
  promptAgentResumeResult?.activePaths.get("improveResponse");

if (improveResponseStepResult?.status === "suspended") {
  console.log("Workflow suspended at improveResponse step");

  // Resume again with different context
  const finalResult = await run.resume({
    stepId: "improveResponse",
    context: { refinedOutput: "Human refined output" },
  });

  console.log("Workflow completed:", finalResult?.results);
}
```

## Event-Based Suspension and Resumption

In addition to manually suspending steps, Mastra provides event-based suspension through the `afterEvent` method. This allows workflows to automatically suspend and wait for a specific event to occur before continuing.

### Using afterEvent and resumeWithEvent

The `afterEvent` method automatically creates a suspension point in your workflow that waits for a specific event to occur. When the event happens, you can use `resumeWithEvent` to continue the workflow with the event data.

Here's how it works:

1. Define events in your workflow configuration
2. Use `afterEvent` to create a suspension point waiting for that event
3. When the event occurs, call `resumeWithEvent` with the event name and data

### Example: Event-Based Workflow

```typescript
// Define steps
const getUserInput = new Step({
  id: "getUserInput",
  execute: async () => ({ userInput: "initial input" }),
  outputSchema: z.object({ userInput: z.string() }),
});

const processApproval = new Step({
  id: "processApproval",
  execute: async ({ context }) => {
    // Access the event data from the context
    const approvalData = context.inputData?.resumedEvent;
    return {
      approved: approvalData?.approved,
      approvedBy: approvalData?.approverName,
    };
  },
  outputSchema: z.object({
    approved: z.boolean(),
    approvedBy: z.string(),
  }),
});

// Create workflow with event definition
const approvalWorkflow = new Workflow({
  name: "approval-workflow",
  triggerSchema: z.object({ requestId: z.string() }),
  events: {
    approvalReceived: {
      schema: z.object({
        approved: z.boolean(),
        approverName: z.string(),
      }),
    },
  },
});

// Build workflow with event-based suspension
approvalWorkflow
  .step(getUserInput)
  .afterEvent("approvalReceived") // Workflow will automatically suspend here
  .step(processApproval) // This step runs after the event is received
  .commit();
```

### Running an Event-Based Workflow

```typescript
// Get the workflow
const workflow = mastra.getWorkflow("approval-workflow");
const run = workflow.createRun();

// Start the workflow
const initialResult = await run.start({
  triggerData: { requestId: "request-123" },
});

console.log("Workflow started, waiting for approval event");
console.log(initialResult.results);
// Output will show the workflow is suspended at the event step:
// {
//   getUserInput: { status: 'success', output: { userInput: 'initial input' } },
//   __approvalReceived_event: { status: 'suspended' }
// }

// Later, when the approval event occurs:
const resumeResult = await run.resumeWithEvent("approvalReceived", {
  approved: true,
  approverName: "Jane Doe",
});

console.log("Workflow resumed with event data:", resumeResult.results);
// Output will show the completed workflow:
// {
//   getUserInput: { status: 'success', output: { userInput: 'initial input' } },
//   __approvalReceived_event: { status: 'success', output: { executed: true, resumedEvent: { approved: true, approverName: 'Jane Doe' } } },
//   processApproval: { status: 'success', output: { approved: true, approvedBy: 'Jane Doe' } }
// }
```

### Key Points About Event-Based Workflows

- The `suspend()` function can optionally take a payload object that will be stored with the suspended state
- Code after the `await suspend()` call will not execute until the step is resumed
- When a step is suspended, its status becomes `'suspended'` in the workflow results
- When resumed, the step's status changes from `'suspended'` to `'success'` once completed
- The `resume()` method requires the `stepId` to identify which suspended step to resume
- You can provide new context data when resuming that will be merged with existing step results

- Events must be defined in the workflow configuration with a schema
- The `afterEvent` method creates a special suspended step that waits for the event
- The event step is automatically named `__eventName_event` (e.g., `__approvalReceived_event`)
- Use `resumeWithEvent` to provide event data and continue the workflow
- Event data is validated against the schema defined for that event
- The event data is available in the context as `inputData.resumedEvent`

## Storage for Suspend and Resume

When a workflow is suspended using `await suspend()`, Mastra automatically persists the entire workflow state to storage. This is essential for workflows that might remain suspended for extended periods, as it ensures the state is preserved across application restarts or server instances.

### Default Storage: LibSQL

By default, Mastra uses LibSQL as its storage engine:

```typescript
import { Mastra } from "@mastra/core/mastra";
import { DefaultStorage } from "@mastra/core/storage/libsql";

const mastra = new Mastra({
  storage: new DefaultStorage({
    config: {
      url: "file:storage.db", // Local file-based database for development
      // For production, use a persistent URL:
      // url: process.env.DATABASE_URL,
      // authToken: process.env.DATABASE_AUTH_TOKEN, // Optional for authenticated connections
    },
  }),
});
```

The LibSQL storage can be configured in different modes:

- In-memory database (testing): `:memory:`
- File-based database (development): `file:storage.db`
- Remote database (production): URLs like `libsql://your-database.turso.io`

### Alternative Storage Options

#### Upstash (Redis-Compatible)

For serverless applications or environments where Redis is preferred:

```bash
npm install @mastra/upstash
```

```typescript
import { Mastra } from "@mastra/core/mastra";
import { UpstashStore } from "@mastra/upstash";

const mastra = new Mastra({
  storage: new UpstashStore({
    url: process.env.UPSTASH_URL,
    token: process.env.UPSTASH_TOKEN,
  }),
});
```

### Storage Considerations

- All storage options support suspend and resume functionality identically
- The workflow state is automatically serialized and saved when suspended
- No additional configuration is needed for suspend/resume to work with storage
- Choose your storage option based on your infrastructure, scaling needs, and existing technology stack

## Watching and Resuming

To handle suspended workflows, use the `watch` method to monitor workflow status per run and `resume` to continue execution:

```typescript
import { mastra } from "./index";

// Get the workflow
const myWorkflow = mastra.getWorkflow("myWorkflow");
const { start, watch, resume } = myWorkflow.createRun();

// Start watching the workflow before executing it
watch(async ({ activePaths }) => {
  const isStepTwoSuspended = activePaths.get("stepTwo")?.status === "suspended";
  if (isStepTwoSuspended) {
    console.log("Workflow suspended, resuming with new value");

    // Resume the workflow with new context
    await resume({
      stepId: "stepTwo",
      context: { secondValue: 100 },
    });
  }
});

// Start the workflow execution
await start({ triggerData: { inputValue: 45 } });
```

### Watching and Resuming Event-Based Workflows

You can use the same watching pattern with event-based workflows:

```typescript
const { start, watch, resumeWithEvent } = workflow.createRun();

// Watch for suspended event steps
watch(async ({ activePaths }) => {
  const isApprovalReceivedSuspended =
    activePaths.get("__approvalReceived_event")?.status === "suspended";
  if (isApprovalReceivedSuspended) {
    console.log("Workflow waiting for approval event");

    // In a real scenario, you would wait for the actual event to occur
    // For example, this could be triggered by a webhook or user interaction
    setTimeout(async () => {
      await resumeWithEvent("approvalReceived", {
        approved: true,
        approverName: "Auto Approver",
      });
    }, 5000); // Simulate event after 5 seconds
  }
});

// Start the workflow
await start({ triggerData: { requestId: "auto-123" } });
```
