## Amazon EC2

Deploy your Mastra applications to Amazon EC2 (Elastic Cloud Compute).

<Callout>
  This guide assumes your Mastra application has been created using the default
  `npx create-mastra@latest` command.
  For more information on how to create a new Mastra application,
  refer to our [getting started guide](/docs/getting-started/installation)
</Callout>

### Prerequisites

- An AWS account with [EC2](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/) access
- An EC2 instance running Ubuntu 24+ or Amazon Linux
- A domain name with an A record pointing to your instance
- A reverse proxy configured (e.g., using [nginx](https://nginx.org/))
- SSL certificate configured (e.g., using [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/))
- Node.js 18+ installed on your instance

### Deployment Steps

<Steps>

#### Clone your Mastra application

Connect to your EC2 instance and clone your repository:

<Tabs items={["Public Repository", "Private Repository"]}>
<Tabs.Tab>

```bash copy
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/<your-repository>.git
```

</Tabs.Tab>

<Tabs.Tab>

```bash copy
git clone https://<your-username>:<your-personal-access-token>@github.com/<your-username>/<your-repository>.git
```

</Tabs.Tab>
</Tabs>

Navigate to the repository directory:

```bash copy
cd "<your-repository>"
```

#### Install dependencies

```bash copy
npm install
```

#### Set up environment variables

Create a `.env` file and add your environment variables:

```bash copy
touch .env
```

Edit the `.env` file and add your environment variables:

```bash copy
OPENAI_API_KEY=<your-openai-api-key>
# Add other required environment variables
```

#### Build the application

```bash copy
npm run build
```

#### Run the application

```bash copy
node --import=./.mastra/output/instrumentation.mjs --env-file=".env" .mastra/output/index.mjs
```

<Callout>
Your Mastra application will run on port 4111 by default. Ensure your reverse proxy is configured to forward requests to this port.
</Callout>

</Steps>

### Connect to your Mastra server

You can now connect to your Mastra server from your client application using a `MastraClient` from the `@mastra/client-js` package.

Refer to the [`MastraClient` documentation](/docs/client-js/overview) for more information.

```typescript copy showLineNumbers
import { MastraClient } from "@mastra/client-js";

const mastraClient = new MastraClient({
  baseUrl: "https://<your-domain-name>",
});
```
