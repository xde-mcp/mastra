# Agent Tool Selection

Tools are typed functions that can be executed by agents or workflows, with built-in integration access and parameter validation. Each tool has a schema that defines its inputs, an executor function that implements its logic, and access to configured integrations.

## Creating Tools

In this section, we'll walk through the process of creating a tool that can be used by your agents. Let's create a simple tool that fetches current weather information for a given city.

```typescript filename="src/mastra/tools/weatherInfo.ts" copy
import { createTool } from "@mastra/core/tools";
import { z } from "zod";

const getWeatherInfo = async (city: string) => {
  // Replace with an actual API call to a weather service
  const data = await fetch(`https://api.example.com/weather?city=${city}`).then(
    (r) => r.json(),
  );
  return data;
};

export const weatherInfo = createTool({
  id: "Get Weather Information",
  inputSchema: z.object({
    city: z.string(),
  }),
  description: `Fetches the current weather information for a given city`,
  execute: async ({ context: { city } }) => {
    console.log("Using tool to fetch weather information for", city);
    return await getWeatherInfo(city);
  },
});
```

## Adding Tools to an Agent

Now we'll add the tool to an agent. We'll create an agent that can answer questions about the weather and configure it to use our `weatherInfo` tool.

```typescript filename="src/mastra/agents/weatherAgent.ts"
import { Agent } from "@mastra/core/agent";
import { openai } from "@ai-sdk/openai";
import * as tools from "../tools/weatherInfo";

export const weatherAgent = new Agent<typeof tools>({
  name: "Weather Agent",
  instructions:
    "You are a helpful assistant that provides current weather information. When asked about the weather, use the weather information tool to fetch the data.",
  model: openai("gpt-4o-mini"),
  tools: {
    weatherInfo: tools.weatherInfo,
  },
});
```

## Registering the Agent

We need to initialize Mastra with our agent.

```typescript filename="src/index.ts"
import { Mastra } from "@mastra/core";
import { weatherAgent } from "./agents/weatherAgent";

export const mastra = new Mastra({
  agents: { weatherAgent },
});
```

This registers your agent with Mastra, making it available for use.

## Abort Signals

The abort signals from `generate` and `stream` (text generation) are forwarded to the tool execution. You can access them in the second parameter of the execute function and e.g. abort long-running computations or forward them to fetch calls inside tools.

```typescript
import { Agent } from "@mastra/core/agent";
import { createTool } from "@mastra/core/tools";
import { z } from "zod";

const agent = new Agent({
  name: "Weather agent",
  tools: {
    weather: createTool({
      id: "Get Weather Information",
      description: "Get the weather in a location",
      inputSchema: z.object({ location: z.string() }),
      execute: async ({ context: { location } }, { abortSignal }) => {
        return fetch(
          `https://api.weatherapi.com/v1/current.json?q=${location}`,
          { signal: abortSignal }, // forward the abort signal to fetch
        );
      },
    }),
  },
});

const result = await agent.generate("What is the weather in San Francisco?", {
  abortSignal: myAbortSignal, // signal that will be forwarded to tools
});
```

## Injecting Request/User-Specific Variables

We support dependency injection for tools and workflows. You can pass a container directly to your `generate` or `stream` function calls, or inject it using [server middleware](/docs/deployment/server#Middleware).

Here's an example where we change the temperature scale between Fahrenheit and Celsius:

```typescript filename="src/agents/weather-agent.ts"
import { Agent } from "@mastra/core/agent";
import { createTool } from "@mastra/core/tools";
import { z } from "zod";

export const agent = new Agent({
  name: "Weather agent",
  tools: {
    weather: createTool({
      id: "Get Weather Information",
      description: "Get the weather in a location",
      inputSchema: z.object({ location: z.string() }),
      execute: async ({ context: { location }, container }) => {
        const scale = container.get("temperature-scale");

        const result = await fetch(
          `https://api.weatherapi.com/v1/current.json?q=${location}`,
        );

        const json = await result.json();

        return {
          temperature: scale === "celsius" ? json.temp_c : json.temp_f,
        };
      },
    }),
  },
});
```

```typescript
import { agent } from "./agents/weather";

type MyContainer = {"temperature-scale", "celsius" | "farenheit"}

const container = new Container<MyContainer>();
container.set("temperature-scale", "celsius");

const result = await agent.generate("What is the weather in San Francisco?", {
  container,
});
```

Let's derive temperature from the user's country using cloudflare ` CF-IPCountry` header. We're keeping the same agent code as the example above

```typescript filename="src/index.ts"
import { Mastra } from "@mastra/core";
import { Container } from "@mastra/core/di";
import { agent as weatherAgent } from "./agents/weather";

type MyContainer = {"temperature-scale", "celsius" | "farenheit"}

export const mastra = new Mastra({
  agents: {
    weather: weatherAgent,
  },
  server: {
    middleware: [
      (c, next) => {
        const country = c.req.header("CF-IPCountry");
        const container: MyContainer = c.get("container");

        container.set(
          "temperature-scale",
          country === "US" ? "farenheit" : "celsius",
        );
      },
    ],
  },
});
```

## Debugging Tools

You can test tools using Vitest or any other testing framework. Writing unit tests for your tools ensures they behave as expected and helps catch errors early.

## Calling an Agent with a Tool

Now we can call the agent, and it will use the tool to fetch the weather information.

## Example: Interacting with the Agent

```typescript filename="src/index.ts"
import { mastra } from "./index";

async function main() {
  const agent = mastra.getAgent("weatherAgent");
  const response = await agent.generate(
    "What's the weather like in New York City today?",
  );

  console.log(response.text);
}

main();
```

The agent will use the `weatherInfo` tool to get the current weather in New York City and respond accordingly.

## Vercel AI SDK Tool Format

Mastra supports tools created using the Vercel AI SDK format. You can import and use these tools directly:

```typescript filename="src/mastra/tools/vercelTool.ts" copy
import { tool } from "ai";
import { z } from "zod";

export const weatherInfo = tool({
  description: "Fetches the current weather information for a given city",
  parameters: z.object({
    city: z.string().describe("The city to get weather for"),
  }),
  execute: async ({ city }) => {
    // Replace with actual API call
    const data = await fetch(`https://api.example.com/weather?city=${city}`);
    return data.json();
  },
});
```

You can use Vercel tools alongside Mastra tools in your agents:

```typescript filename="src/mastra/agents/weatherAgent.ts"
import { Agent } from "@mastra/core/agent";
import { openai } from "@ai-sdk/openai";
import { weatherInfo } from "../tools/vercelTool";
import * as mastraTools from "../tools/mastraTools";

export const weatherAgent = new Agent({
  name: "Weather Agent",
  instructions:
    "You are a helpful assistant that provides weather information.",
  model: openai("gpt-4"),
  tools: {
    weatherInfo, // Vercel tool
    ...mastraTools, // Mastra tools
  },
});
```

Both tool formats will work seamlessly within your agent's workflow.

## Tool Design Best Practices

When creating tools for your agents, following these guidelines will help ensure reliable and intuitive tool usage:

### Tool Descriptions

Your tool's main description should focus on its purpose and value:

- Keep descriptions simple and focused on **what** the tool does
- Emphasize the tool's primary use case
- Avoid implementation details in the main description
- Focus on helping the agent understand **when** to use the tool

```typescript
createTool({
  id: "documentSearch",
  description:
    "Access the knowledge base to find information needed to answer user questions",
  // ... rest of tool configuration
});
```

### Parameter Schemas

Technical details belong in the parameter schemas, where they help the agent use the tool correctly:

- Make parameters self-documenting with clear descriptions
- Include default values and their implications
- Provide examples where helpful
- Describe the impact of different parameter choices

```typescript
inputSchema: z.object({
  query: z.string().describe("The search query to find relevant information"),
  limit: z.number().describe(
    "Number of results to return. Higher values provide more context, lower values focus on best matches"
  ),
  options: z.string().describe(
    "Optional configuration. Example: '{'filter': 'category=news'}'"
  ),
}),
```

### Agent Interaction Patterns

Tools are more likely to be used effectively when:

- Queries or tasks are complex enough to clearly require tool assistance
- Agent instructions provide clear guidance on tool usage
- Parameter requirements are well-documented in the schema
- The tool's purpose aligns with the query's needs

### Common Pitfalls

- Overloading the main description with technical details
- Mixing implementation details with usage guidance
- Unclear parameter descriptions or missing examples

Following these practices helps ensure your tools are discoverable and usable by agents while maintaining clean separation between purpose (main description) and implementation details (parameter schemas).

## Model Context Protocol (MCP) Tools

Mastra also supports tools from MCP-compatible servers through the `@mastra/mcp` package. MCP provides a standardized way for AI models to discover and interact with external tools and resources. This makes it easy to integrate third-party tools into your agents without writing custom integrations.

For detailed information about using MCP tools, including configuration options and best practices, see our [MCP guide](/docs/agents/mcp-guide).
