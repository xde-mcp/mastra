# AI SDK v5 (beta) Migration Guide

This guide covers Mastra-specific considerations when migrating from AI SDK v4 to v5 beta.

Please add any feedback or bug reports to the [AI SDK v5 mega issue in Github.](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/issues/5470)

## Official Migration Guide

**Follow the official [AI SDK v5 Migration Guide](https://v5.ai-sdk.dev/docs/migration-guides/migration-guide-5-0)** for all AI SDK core breaking changes, package updates, and API changes.

This guide covers only the Mastra-specific aspects of the migration.

## Warnings

- **Data compatibility**: New data stored in v5 format will no longer work if you downgrade from the beta
- **Backup recommendation**: Keep DB backups from before you upgrade to v5 beta
- **Production use**: Wait for the AI SDK v5 stable release before using in production applications
- **Prerelease status**: The Mastra `ai-v5` tag is a prerelease version and may have bugs

## Memory Storage

Your existing AI SDK v4 data will run through our internal `MessageList` class which handles converting to/from various message formats.
This includes converting from AI SDK v4->v5. This means you don't need to run any DB migrations and your data will be translated on the fly and will just work when you upgrade.


## Migration Strategy

Migrating to AI SDK v5 with Mastra involves updating both your **backend** (Mastra server) and **frontend**.
We provide a compatibility mode to handle stream format conversion during the transition.

### Backend Upgrade

Bump Mastra to the new `ai-v5` prerelease version for all Mastra packages:

```bash npm2yarn copy
npm i mastra@ai-v5 @mastra/core@ai-v5 @mastra/memory@ai-v5 [etc]
```

Then configure your Mastra instance with v4 compatibility so your existing frontend will continue to work:

```typescript
import { Mastra } from '@mastra/core';

export const mastra = new Mastra({
  agents: { myAgent },
  aiSdkCompat: 'v4', // <- add this for compatibility
});
```

**Dependencies**: You will need to upgrade all AI SDK dependencies to use the new v5 beta versions in your backend when you bump to the Mastra `ai-v5` prerelease tag. In most cases this will only involve bumping your model provider packages. For example: `npm i @ai-sdk/openai@2.0.0-beta.1` - refer to the [AI SDK v5 documentation](https://v5.ai-sdk.dev/docs/migration-guides/migration-guide-5-0) for more info. Some model providers do not yet have V5 versions (Openrouter for example).

### Frontend Upgrade

When you're ready, remove the compatibility flag and upgrade your frontend:

1. Remove `aiSdkCompat: 'v4'` from your Mastra configuration
2. Follow the AI SDK guide on upgrading your frontend dependencies
3. Update your frontend code for v5 breaking changes
