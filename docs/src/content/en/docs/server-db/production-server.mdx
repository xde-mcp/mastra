# Create a Mastra Production Server

When deploying your Mastra application to production, it runs as an HTTP server that exposes your agents, workflows, and other functionality as API endpoints. This page covers how to configure and customize the server for a production environment.

## Server Architecture

Mastra uses [Hono](https://hono.dev) as its underlying HTTP server framework. When you build a Mastra application using `mastra build`, it generates a Hono-based HTTP server in the `.mastra` directory.

The server provides:

- API endpoints for all registered agents
- API endpoints for all registered workflows
- Custom API route support
- Custom middleware support
- Configuration of timeout
- Configuration of port
- Configuration of body limit

See the [Middleware](/docs/server-db/middleware) and
[Custom API Routes](/docs/server-db/custom-api-routes) pages for details on
adding additional server behaviour.

## Server configuration

You can configure server `port` and `timeout` in the Mastra instance.

```typescript filename="src/mastra/index.ts" copy showLineNumbers
import { Mastra } from "@mastra/core/mastra";

export const mastra = new Mastra({
  // ...
  server: {
    port: 3000, // Defaults to 4111
    timeout: 10000, // Defaults to 30000 (30s)
  },
});
```

The `method` option can be one of `"GET"`, `"POST"`, `"PUT"`,
`"DELETE"` or `"ALL"`. Using `"ALL"` will cause the handler to be
invoked for any HTTP method that matches the path.

## Custom CORS Config

Mastra allows you to configure CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) settings for your server.

```typescript filename="src/mastra/index.ts" copy showLineNumbers
import { Mastra } from "@mastra/core/mastra";

export const mastra = new Mastra({
  // ...
  server: {
    cors: {
      origin: ["https://example.com"], // Allow specific origins or '*' for all
      allowMethods: ["GET", "POST", "PUT", "DELETE", "OPTIONS"],
      allowHeaders: ["Content-Type", "Authorization"],
      credentials: false,
    },
  },
});
```
