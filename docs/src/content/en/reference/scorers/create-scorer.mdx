# createScorer

Mastra provides a unified `createScorer` factory that allows you to define custom scorers for evaluating input/output pairs. You can use either native JavaScript functions or LLM-based prompt objects for each evaluation step. Custom scorers can be added to Agents and Workflow steps.

## How to Create a Custom Scorer

Use the `createScorer` factory to define your scorer with a name, description, and optional judge configuration. Then chain step methods to build your evaluation pipeline. You must provide at least a `generateScore` step.

```typescript
const scorer = createScorer({
  name: "My Custom Scorer",
  description: "Evaluates responses based on custom criteria",
  judge: {
    model: myModel,
    instructions: "You are an expert evaluator..."
  }
})
.preprocess({ /* step config */ })
.analyze({ /* step config */ })
.generateScore(({ run, results }) => {
  // Return a number
})
.generateReason({ /* step config */ });
```

## createScorer Options

<PropertiesTable
  content={[
    {
      name: "name",
      type: "string",
      required: true,
      description: "Name of the scorer.",
    },
    {
      name: "description",
      type: "string",
      required: true,
      description: "Description of what the scorer does.",
    },
    {
      name: "judge",
      type: "object",
      required: false,
      description: "Optional judge configuration for LLM-based steps. See Judge Object section below.",
    },
  ]}
/>

This function returns a scorer builder that you can chain step methods onto. See the [MastraScorer reference](./mastra-scorer) for details on the `.run()` method and its input/output.

## Judge Object

<PropertiesTable
  content={[
    {
      name: "model",
      type: "LanguageModel",
      required: true,
      description: "The LLM model instance to use for evaluation.",
    },
    {
      name: "instructions",
      type: "string",
      required: true,
      description: "System prompt/instructions for the LLM.",
    },
  ]}
/>

## Type Safety

For better type inference and IntelliSense support, you can specify input/output types when creating scorers:

```typescript
import { createScorer, ScorerRunInputForAgent, ScorerRunOutputForAgent } from '@mastra/core';

// For agent evaluation with full type safety
const agentScorer = createScorer<ScorerRunInputForAgent, ScorerRunOutputForAgent>({
  name: 'Agent Response Quality',
  description: 'Evaluates agent responses'
})
.preprocess(({ run }) => {
  // run.input is typed as ScorerRunInputForAgent
  const userMessage = run.input.inputMessages[0]?.content;
  return { userMessage };
})
.generateScore(({ run, results }) => {
  // run.output is typed as ScorerRunOutputForAgent  
  const response = run.output[0]?.content;
  return response.length > 10 ? 1.0 : 0.5;
});

// For custom input/output types
type CustomInput = { query: string; context: string[] };
type CustomOutput = { answer: string; confidence: number };

const customScorer = createScorer<CustomInput, CustomOutput>({
  name: 'Custom Scorer',
  description: 'Evaluates custom data'
})
.generateScore(({ run }) => run.output.confidence);
```

### Built-in Agent Types

- **`ScorerRunInputForAgent`** - Contains `inputMessages`, `rememberedMessages`, `systemMessages`, and `taggedSystemMessages` for agent evaluation
- **`ScorerRunOutputForAgent`** - Array of agent response messages

Using these types provides autocomplete, compile-time validation, and better documentation for your scoring logic.

## Step Method Signatures

### preprocess

Optional preprocessing step that can extract or transform data before analysis.

**Function Mode:**
Function: `({ run, results }) => any`

<PropertiesTable
  content={[
    {
      name: "run.input",
      type: "any",
      required: true,
      description: "Input records provided to the scorer. If the scorer is added to an agent, this will be an array of user messages, e.g. `[{ role: 'user', content: 'hello world' }]`. If the scorer is used in a workflow, this will be the input of the workflow.",
    },
    {
      name: "run.output",
      type: "any",
      required: true,
      description: "Output record provided to the scorer. For agents, this is usually the agent's response. For workflows, this is the workflow's output.",
    },
    {
      name: "run.runId",
      type: "string",
      required: true,
      description: "Unique identifier for this scoring run.",

      description: "Input records provided to the scorer. If the scorer is added to an agent, this will be an array of user messages, e.g. `[{ role: 'user', content: 'hello world' }]`. If the scorer is used in a workflow, this will be the input of the workflow.",
    },
    {
      name: "run.output",
      type: "any",
      required: true,
      description: "Output record provided to the scorer. For agents, this is usually the agent's response. For workflows, this is the workflow's output.",
    },
    {
      name: "run.runId",
      type: "string",
      required: true,
      description: "Unique identifier for this scoring run.",
    },
    {
      name: "run.runtimeContext",
      type: "object",
      required: false,
      description: "Runtime context from the agent or workflow step being evaluated (optional).",
    },
    {
      name: "results.preprocessStepResult",
      type: "any",
      required: false,
      description: "Result from preprocess step, if defined (optional).",

    },
    {
      name: "createPrompt",
      type: "function",
      required: true,
      description: "Function: ({ run, results, score }) => string. Returns the prompt for the LLM.",
    },
    {
      name: "judge",
      type: "object",
      required: false,
      description: "(Optional) LLM judge for this step (can override main judge). See Judge Object section.",
    },
  ]}
/>

All step functions can be async.
