# Completeness Evaluation

<ScorerCallout />

Use `CompletenessMetric` to evaluate whether the response includes all key elements from the input. The metric accepts a `query` and a `response`, and returns a score and an `info` object with detailed element level comparisons.

## Installation

```bash copy
npm install @mastra/evals
```

## Complete coverage example

In this example, the response contains every element from the input. The content matches exactly, resulting in full coverage.

```typescript filename="src/example-complete-coverage.ts" showLineNumbers copy
import { CompletenessMetric } from "@mastra/evals/nlp";

const metric = new CompletenessMetric();

const query = "The primary colors are red, blue, and yellow.";
const response = "The primary colors are red, blue, and yellow.";

const result = await metric.measure(query, response);

console.log(result);
```

### Complete coverage output

The output receives a score of 1 because all input elements are present in the response with no missing content.

```typescript
{
  score: 1,
  info: {
    inputElements: [
      'the',    'primary',
      'colors', 'be',
      'red',    'blue',
      'and',    'yellow'
    ],
    outputElements: [
      'the',    'primary',
      'colors', 'be',
      'red',    'blue',
      'and',    'yellow'
    ],
    missingElements: [],
    elementCounts: { input: 8, output: 8 }
  }
}
```

## Partial coverage example

In this example, the response includes all of the input elements, but also adds extra content that wasn’t in the original query.

```typescript filename="src/example-partial-coverage.ts" showLineNumbers copy
import { CompletenessMetric } from "@mastra/evals/nlp";

const metric = new CompletenessMetric();

const query = "The primary colors are red and blue.";
const response = "The primary colors are red, blue, and yellow.";

const result = await metric.measure(query, response);

console.log(result);
```

### Partial coverage output

The output receives a high score because no input elements are missing. However, the response includes additional content that goes beyond the input.

```typescript
{
  score: 1,
  info: {
    inputElements: [
      'the',    'primary',
      'colors', 'be',
      'red',    'and',
      'blue'
    ],
    outputElements: [
      'the',    'primary',
      'colors', 'be',
      'red',    'blue',
      'and',    'yellow'
    ],
    missingElements: [],
    elementCounts: { input: 7, output: 8 }
  }
}
```

## Minimal coverage example

In this example, the response contains only some of the elements from the input. Key terms are missing or altered, resulting in reduced coverage.

```typescript filename="src/example-minimal-coverage.ts" showLineNumbers copy
import { CompletenessMetric } from "@mastra/evals/nlp";

const metric = new CompletenessMetric();

const query = "The seasons include summer.";
const response = "The four seasons are spring, summer, fall, and winter.";

const result = await metric.measure(query, response);

console.log(result);
```

### Minimal coverage output

The output receives a lower score because one or more elements from the input are missing. The response overlaps in part, but does not fully reflect the original content.

```typescript
{
  score: 0.75,
  info: {
    inputElements: [ 'the', 'seasons', 'summer', 'include' ],
    outputElements: [
      'the',     'four',
      'seasons', 'spring',
      'summer',  'winter',
      'be',      'fall',
      'and'
    ],
    missingElements: [ 'include' ],
    elementCounts: { input: 4, output: 9 }
  }
}
```

## Metric configuration

You can create a `CompletenessMetric` instance with default settings. No additional configuration is required.

```typescript showLineNumbers copy
const metric = new CompletenessMetric();
```
> See [CompletenessMetric](/reference/evals/completeness.mdx) for a full list of configuration options.

## Understanding the results

`CompletenessMetric` returns a result in the following shape:

```typescript
{
  score: number,
  info: {
    inputElements: string[],
    outputElements: string[],
    missingElements: string[],
    elementCounts: {
      input: number,
      output: number
    }
  }
}

```

### Completeness score

A completeness score between 0 and 1:

- **1.0**: All input elements are present in the response.
- **0.7–0.9**: Most key elements are included, with minimal omissions.
- **0.4–0.6**: Some input elements are covered, but important ones are missing.
- **0.1–0.3**: Few input elements are matched; most are missing.
- **0.0**: No input elements are present in the response.

### Completeness info

An explanation for the score, with details including:

- Input elements extracted from the query.
- Output elements matched in the response.
- Any input elements missing from the response.
- Comparison of element counts between input and output.
