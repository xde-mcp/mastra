# LLM as a Judge Evaluation

<ScorerCallout />

This example shows how to create a custom LLM-based evaluation metric to determine real countries of the world. The metric accepts a `query` and a `response`, and returns a score and reason based on how accurately the response matches the query.

## Installation

```bash copy
npm install @mastra/evals
```

## Create a custom eval

A custom eval in Mastra can use an LLM to judge the quality of a response based on structured prompts and evaluation criteria. It consists of four core components:

1. [**Instructions**](#eval-instructions)
2. [**Prompt**](#eval-prompt)
3. [**Judge**](#eval-judge)
4. [**Metric**](#eval-metric)

Together, these allow you to define custom evaluation logic that might not be covered by Mastra's built-in metrics.

```typescript filename="src/mastra/evals/example-real-world-countries.ts" showLineNumbers copy
import { Metric, type MetricResult } from "@mastra/core";
import { MastraAgentJudge } from "@mastra/evals/judge";
import { type LanguageModel } from "@mastra/core/llm";
import { z } from "zod";

const INSTRUCTIONS = `You are a geography expert. Score how many valid countries are listed in a response, based on the original question.`;

const generatePrompt = (query: string, response: string) => `

Here is the query: "${query}"
Here is the response: "${response}"

Evaluate how many valid, real countries are listed in the response.

Return:
{
  "score": number (0 to 1),
  "info": {
    "reason": string,
    "matches": [string, string],
    "misses": [string]
  }
}
`;

class WorldCountryJudge extends MastraAgentJudge {
  constructor(model: LanguageModel) {
    super("WorldCountryJudge", INSTRUCTIONS, model);
  }

  async evaluate(query: string, response: string): Promise<MetricResult> {
    const prompt = generatePrompt(query, response);
    const result = await this.agent.generate(prompt, {
      output: z.object({
        score: z.number().min(0).max(1),
        info: z.object({
          reason: z.string(),
          matches: z.array(z.string()),
          misses: z.array(z.string())
        })
      })
    });

    return result.object;
  }
}

export class WorldCountryMetric extends Metric {
  judge: WorldCountryJudge;

  constructor(model: LanguageModel) {
    super();
    this.judge = new WorldCountryJudge(model);
  }

  async measure(query: string, response: string): Promise<MetricResult> {
    return this.judge.evaluate(query, response);
  }
}
```

### Eval instructions

Defines the role of the judge and sets expectations for how the LLM should assess the response.

### Eval prompt

Builds a consistent evaluation prompt using the `query` and `response`, guiding the LLM to return a `score` and a structured `info` object.

### Eval judge

Extends `MastraAgentJudge` to manage prompt generation and scoring.

- `generatePrompt()` combines instructions with the query and response.
- `evaluate()` sends the prompt to the LLM and validates the output with a Zod schema.
- Returns a `MetricResult` with a numeric `score` and a customizable `info` object.

### Eval metric

Extends Mastra’s `Metric` class and acts as the main evaluation entry point. It uses the judge to compute and return results via `measure()`.

## High custom example

This example shows a strong alignment between the response and the evaluation criteria. The metric assigns a high score and includes supporting details to explain why the output meets expectations.

```typescript filename="src/example-high-real-world-countries.ts" showLineNumbers copy
import { openai } from "@ai-sdk/openai";
import { WorldCountryMetric } from "./mastra/evals/example-real-world-countries";

const metric = new WorldCountryMetric(openai("gpt-4o-mini"));

const query = "Name some countries of the World.";
const response = "France, Japan, Argentina";

const result = await metric.measure(query, response);

console.log(result);
```

### High custom output

The output receives a high score because everything in the response matches what the judge is looking for. The `info` object adds useful context to help understand why the score was awarded.

```typescript
{
  score: 1,
  info: {
    reason: 'All listed countries are valid and recognized countries in the world.',
    matches: [ 'France', 'Japan', 'Argentina' ],
    misses: []
  }
}
```

## Partial custom example

In this example, the response includes a mix of correct and incorrect elements. The metric returns a mid-range score to reflect this and provides details to explain what was right and what was missed.

```typescript filename="src/example-partial-real-world-countries.ts" showLineNumbers copy
import { openai } from "@ai-sdk/openai";
import { WorldCountryMetric } from "./mastra/evals/example-real-world-countries";

const metric = new WorldCountryMetric(openai("gpt-4o-mini"));

const query = "Name some countries of the World.";
const response = "Germany, Narnia, Australia";

const result = await metric.measure(query, response);

console.log(result);
```

### Partial custom output

The score reflects partial success because the response includes some valid, and some invalid items that don’t meet the criteria. The `info` field gives a breakdown of what matched and what didn’t.

```typescript
{
  score: 0.67,
  info: {
    reason: 'Two out of three listed are valid countries.',
    matches: [ 'Germany', 'Australia' ],
    misses: [ 'Narnia' ]
  }
}
```

## Low custom example

In this example, the response doesn’t meet the evaluation criteria at all. None of the expected elements are present, so the metric returns a low score.

```typescript filename="src/example-low-real-world-countries.ts" showLineNumbers copy
import { openai } from "@ai-sdk/openai";
import { WorldCountryMetric } from "./mastra/evals/example-real-world-countries";

const metric = new WorldCountryMetric(openai("gpt-4o-mini"));

const query = "Name some countries of the World.";
const response = "Gotham, Wakanda, Atlantis";

const result = await metric.measure(query, response);

console.log(result);
```

### Low custom output

The score is 0 because the response doesn’t include any of the required elements. The `info` field explains the outcome and lists the gaps that led to the result.

```typescript
{
  score: 0,
  info: {
    reason: 'The response contains fictional places rather than real countries.',
    matches: [],
    misses: [ 'Gotham', 'Wakanda', 'Atlantis' ]
  }
}
```

## Understanding the results

`WorldCountryMetric` returns a result in the following shape:

```typescript
{
  score: number,
  info: {
    reason: string,
    matches: string[],
    misses: string[]
  }
}
```

### Custom score

A score between 0 and 1:

- **1.0**: The response includes only valid items with no mistakes.
- **0.7–0.9**: The response is mostly correct but may include one or two incorrect entries.
- **0.4–0.6**: The response is mixed—some valid, some invalid.
- **0.1–0.3**: The response contains mostly incorrect or irrelevant entries.
- **0.0**: The response includes no valid content based on the evaluation criteria.

### Custom info

An explanation for the score, with details including:

- A plain-language reason for the result.
- A `matches` array listing correct elements found in the response.
- A `misses` array showing items that were incorrect or did not meet the criteria.
