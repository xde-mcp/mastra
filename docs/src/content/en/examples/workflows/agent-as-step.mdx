# Agent as a step

Workflows can include agents as steps. This example shows how to define an agent as a step using `createStep()`.

## Creating an agent

Create a simple agent that returns facts about a city.

```typescript filename="src/mastra/agents/example-city-agent.ts" showLineNumbers copy
import { openai } from "@ai-sdk/openai";
import { Agent } from "@mastra/core/agent";

export const cityAgent = new Agent({
  name: "city-agent",
  description: "Create facts for a city",
  instructions: `Return an interesting fact based on the city provided`,
  model: openai("gpt-4o")
});
```

### Agent input/output schema

Mastra agents use a default schema that expects a `prompt` string as input and returns a `text` string as output.

```typescript
{
  inputSchema: {
    prompt: string
  },
  outputSchema: {
    text: string
  }
}
```

## Agent as step

To use an agent as a step, pass it directly to `createStep()`. Use the `.map()` method to transform the workflow input into the shape the agent expects.

In this example, the workflow receives a `city` input, maps it to a `prompt`, then calls the agent. The agent returns a `text` string, which is passed directly to the workflow output. Although the output schema expects a `facts` field, no additional mapping is required.

```typescript filename="src/mastra/workflows/example-agent-step.ts" showLineNumbers copy
import { createWorkflow, createStep } from "@mastra/core/workflows";
import { z } from "zod";

import { cityAgent } from "../agents/example-city-agent";

const step1 = createStep(cityAgent);

export const agentAsStep = createWorkflow({
  id: "agent-step-workflow",
  inputSchema: z.object({
    city: z.string()
  }),
  outputSchema: z.object({
    facts: z.string()
  })
})
  .map(async ({ inputData }) => {
    const { city } = inputData;
    return {
      prompt: `Create an interesting fact about ${city}`
    };
  })

  .then(step1)
  .commit();
```
