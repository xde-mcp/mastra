# voice.close()

The `close()` method disconnects from a real-time voice service and cleans up resources. This is important for properly ending voice sessions and preventing resource leaks.

## Usage Example

```typescript
import { OpenAIRealtimeVoice } from "@mastra/voice-openai-realtime";
import { getMicrophoneStream } from "@mastra/node-audio";

// Initialize a real-time voice provider
const voice = new OpenAIRealtimeVoice({
  realtimeConfig: {
    model: "gpt-4o-mini-realtime",
    apiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY,
  },
});

// Connect to the real-time service
await voice.connect();

// Start a conversation
voice.speak("Hello, I'm your AI assistant!");

// Stream audio from a microphone
const microphoneStream = getMicrophoneStream();
voice.send(microphoneStream);

// When the conversation is complete
setTimeout(() => {
  // Close the connection and clean up resources
  voice.close();
  console.log("Voice session ended");
}, 60000); // End after 1 minute
```

## Parameters

This method does not accept any parameters.

## Return Value

This method does not return a value.

## Notes

- Always call `close()` when you're done with a real-time voice session to free up resources
- After calling `close()`, you'll need to call `connect()` again if you want to start a new session
- This method is primarily used with real-time voice providers that maintain persistent connections
- If called on a voice provider that doesn't support real-time connections, it will log a warning and do nothing
- Failing to close connections can lead to resource leaks and potential billing issues with voice service providers
