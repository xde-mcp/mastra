# voice.on()

The `on()` method registers event listeners for various voice events. This is particularly important for real-time voice providers, where events are used to communicate transcribed text, audio responses, and other state changes.

## Usage Example

```typescript
import { OpenAIRealtimeVoice } from "@mastra/voice-openai-realtime";
import Speaker from "@mastra/node-speaker";
import chalk from "chalk";

// Initialize a real-time voice provider
const voice = new OpenAIRealtimeVoice({
  realtimeConfig: {
    model: "gpt-4o-mini-realtime",
    apiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY,
  },
});

// Connect to the real-time service
await voice.connect();

// Register event listener for transcribed text
voice.on("writing", (event) => {
  if (event.role === 'user') {
    process.stdout.write(chalk.green(event.text));
  } else {
    process.stdout.write(chalk.blue(event.text));
  }
});

// Listen for audio data and play it
const speaker = new Speaker({
  sampleRate: 24100,
  channels: 1,
  bitDepth: 16,
});

voice.on("speaker", (stream) => {
  stream.pipe(speaker);
});

// Register event listener for errors
voice.on("error", ({ message, code, details }) => {
  console.error(`Error ${code}: ${message}`, details);
});
```

## Parameters
<br/>
<PropertiesTable
  content={[
    {
      name: "event",
      type: "string",
      description: "Name of the event to listen for. See the [Voice Events](./voice.events) documentation for a list of available events.",
      isOptional: false,
    },
    {
      name: "callback",
      type: "function",
      description: "Callback function that will be called when the event occurs. The callback signature depends on the specific event.",
      isOptional: false,
    }
  ]}
/>

## Return Value

This method does not return a value.

## Events

For a comprehensive list of events and their payload structures, see the [Voice Events](./voice.events) documentation.

Common events include:

- `speaking`: Emitted when audio data is available
- `speaker`: Emitted with a stream that can be piped to audio output
- `writing`: Emitted when text is transcribed or generated
- `error`: Emitted when an error occurs
- `tool-call-start`: Emitted when a tool is about to be executed
- `tool-call-result`: Emitted when a tool execution is complete

Different voice providers may support different sets of events with varying payload structures.

## Using with CompositeVoice

When using `CompositeVoice`, the `on()` method delegates to the configured real-time provider:

```typescript
import { CompositeVoice } from "@mastra/core/voice";
import { OpenAIRealtimeVoice } from "@mastra/voice-openai-realtime";
import Speaker from "@mastra/node-speaker";

const speaker = new Speaker({
  sampleRate: 24100,  // Audio sample rate in Hz - standard for high-quality audio on MacBook Pro
  channels: 1,        // Mono audio output (as opposed to stereo which would be 2)
  bitDepth: 16,       // Bit depth for audio quality - CD quality standard (16-bit resolution)
});

const realtimeVoice = new OpenAIRealtimeVoice();
const voice = new CompositeVoice({
  realtimeProvider: realtimeVoice,
});

// Connect to the real-time service
await voice.connect();

// This will register the event listener with the OpenAIRealtimeVoice provider
voice.on("speaker", (stream) => {
  stream.pipe(speaker)
});
```

## Notes

- This method is primarily used with real-time voice providers that support event-based communication
- If called on a voice provider that doesn't support events, it will log a warning and do nothing
- Event listeners should be registered before calling methods that might emit events
- To remove an event listener, use the [voice.off()](./voice.off) method with the same event name and callback function
- Multiple listeners can be registered for the same event
- The callback function will receive different data depending on the event type (see [Voice Events](./voice.events))
- For best performance, consider removing event listeners when they are no longer needed
