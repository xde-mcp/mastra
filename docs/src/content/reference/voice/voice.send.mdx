# voice.send()

The `send()` method streams audio data in real-time to voice providers for continuous processing. This method is essential for real-time speech-to-speech conversations, allowing you to send microphone input directly to the AI service.

## Usage Example

```typescript
import { OpenAIRealtimeVoice } from "@mastra/voice-openai-realtime";
import Speaker from "@mastra/node-speaker";
import { getMicrophoneStream } from "@mastra/node-audio";

const speaker = new Speaker({
  sampleRate: 24100,  // Audio sample rate in Hz - standard for high-quality audio on MacBook Pro
  channels: 1,        // Mono audio output (as opposed to stereo which would be 2)
  bitDepth: 16,       // Bit depth for audio quality - CD quality standard (16-bit resolution)
});


// Initialize a real-time voice provider
const voice = new OpenAIRealtimeVoice({
  realtimeConfig: {
    model: "gpt-4o-mini-realtime",
    apiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY,
  },
});

// Connect to the real-time service
await voice.connect();

// Set up event listeners for responses
voice.on("writing", ({ text, role }) => {
  console.log(`${role}: ${text}`);
});

voice.on("speaker", (stream) => {
  stream.pipe(speaker)
});

// Get microphone stream (implementation depends on your environment)
const microphoneStream = getMicrophoneStream();

// Send audio data to the voice provider
await voice.send(microphoneStream);

// You can also send audio data as Int16Array
const audioBuffer = getAudioBuffer(); // Assume this returns Int16Array
await voice.send(audioBuffer);
```

## Parameters
<br/>
<PropertiesTable
  content={[
    {
      name: "audioData",
      type: "NodeJS.ReadableStream | Int16Array",
      description: "Audio data to send to the voice provider. Can be a readable stream (like a microphone stream) or an Int16Array of audio samples.",
      isOptional: false,
    }
  ]}
/>

## Return Value

Returns a `Promise<void>` that resolves when the audio data has been accepted by the voice provider.


## Notes

- This method is only implemented by real-time voice providers that support speech-to-speech capabilities
- If called on a voice provider that doesn't support this functionality, it will log a warning and resolve immediately
- You must call `connect()` before using `send()` to establish the WebSocket connection
- The audio format requirements depend on the specific voice provider
- For continuous conversation, you typically call `send()` to transmit user audio, then `answer()` to trigger the AI response
- The provider will typically emit 'writing' events with transcribed text as it processes the audio
- When the AI responds, the provider will emit 'speaking' events with the audio response
