# Voice Events

Voice providers emit various events during real-time voice interactions. These events can be listened to using the [voice.on()](./voice.on) method and are particularly important for building interactive voice applications.

## Common Events

These events are commonly implemented across real-time voice providers:

<PropertiesTable
  content={[
    {
      name: "error",
      type: "Error",
      description: "Emitted when an error occurs during voice processing or when audio data format is unsupported",
    },
    {
      name: "session.created",
      type: "object",
      description: "Emitted when a new session is created with the OpenAI service",
    },
    {
      name: "session.updated",
      type: "object",
      description: "Emitted when the session configuration is updated",
    },
    {
      name: "response.created",
      type: "object",
      description: "Emitted when a new response is created by the AI assistant",
    },
    {
      name: "response.done",
      type: "object",
      description: "Emitted when the AI assistant has completed its response",
    },
    {
      name: "speaker",
      type: "StreamWithId",
      description: "Emitted with a new audio stream that can be piped to an audio output",
    },
    {
      name: "writing",
      type: "object",
      description: "Emitted when text is being transcribed (user) or generated (assistant)",
    },
    {
      name: "speaking",
      type: "object",
      description: "Emitted when audio data is available from the voice provider",
    },
    {
      name: "speaking.done",
      type: "object",
      description: "Emitted when the voice provider has finished speaking",
    },
    {
      name: "tool-call-start",
      type: "object",
      description: "Emitted when the AI assistant starts executing a tool",
    },
    {
      name: "tool-call-result",
      type: "object",
      description: "Emitted when a tool execution is complete with its result",
    }
  ]}
/>

## Notes

- Not all events are supported by all voice providers
- The exact payload structure may vary between providers
- For non-real-time providers, most of these events will not be emitted
- Events are useful for building interactive UIs that respond to the conversation state
- Consider using the [voice.off()](./voice.off) method to remove event listeners when they are no longer needed
