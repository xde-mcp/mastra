# voice.speak()

The `speak()` method is a core function available in all Mastra voice providers that converts text to speech. It takes text input and returns an audio stream that can be played or saved.

## Usage Example

```typescript
import { OpenAIVoice } from "@mastra/voice-openai";
// Initialize a voice provider
const voice = new OpenAIVoice({
  speaker: "alloy", // Default voice
});
// Basic usage with default settings
const audioStream = await voice.speak("Hello, world!");
// Using a different voice for this specific request
const audioStreamWithDifferentVoice = await voice.speak("Hello again!", {
  speaker: "nova",
});
// Using provider-specific options
const audioStreamWithOptions = await voice.speak("Hello with options!", {
  speaker: "echo",
  speed: 1.2, // OpenAI-specific option
});
// Using a text stream as input
import { Readable } from "stream";
const textStream = Readable.from(["Hello", " from", " a", " stream!"]);
const audioStreamFromTextStream = await voice.speak(textStream);
```


## Parameters

<PropertiesTable
  content={[
    {
      name: "input",
      type: "string | NodeJS.ReadableStream",
      description: "Text to convert to speech. Can be a string or a readable stream of text.",
      isOptional: false,
    },
    {
      name: "options",
      type: "object",
      description: "Options for speech synthesis",
      isOptional: true,
    },
    {
      name: "options.speaker",
      type: "string",
      description: "Voice ID to use for this specific request. Overrides the default speaker set in the constructor.",
      isOptional: true,
    },
  ]}
/>

## Return Value

Returns a `Promise<NodeJS.ReadableStream | void>` where:

- `NodeJS.ReadableStream`: A stream of audio data that can be played or saved
- `void`: When using a realtime voice provider that emits audio through events instead of returning it directly

## Provider-Specific Options

Each voice provider may support additional options specific to their implementation. Here are some examples:

### OpenAI

<PropertiesTable
  content={[
    {
      name: "options.speed",
      type: "number",
      description: "Speech speed multiplier. Values between 0.25 and 4.0 are supported.",
      isOptional: true,
      defaultValue: "1.0",
    }
  ]}
/>

### ElevenLabs

<PropertiesTable
  content={[
    {
      name: "options.stability",
      type: "number",
      description: "Voice stability. Higher values result in more stable, less expressive speech.",
      isOptional: true,
      defaultValue: "0.5",
    },
    {
      name: "options.similarity_boost",
      type: "number",
      description: "Voice clarity and similarity to the original voice.",
      isOptional: true,
      defaultValue: "0.75",
    }
  ]}
/>

### Google

<PropertiesTable
  content={[
    {
      name: "options.languageCode",
      type: "string",
      description: "Language code for the voice (e.g., 'en-US').",
      isOptional: true,
    },
    {
      name: "options.audioConfig",
      type: "object",
      description: "Audio configuration options from Google Cloud Text-to-Speech API.",
      isOptional: true,
      defaultValue: "{ audioEncoding: 'LINEAR16' }",
    }
  ]}
/>

### Murf

<PropertiesTable
  content={[
    {
      name: "options.properties.rate",
      type: "number",
      description: "Speech rate multiplier.",
      isOptional: true,
    },
    {
      name: "options.properties.pitch",
      type: "number",
      description: "Voice pitch adjustment.",
      isOptional: true,
    },
    {
      name: "options.properties.format",
      type: "'MP3' | 'WAV' | 'FLAC' | 'ALAW' | 'ULAW'",
      description: "Output audio format.",
      isOptional: true,
    }
  ]}
/>

## Realtime Voice Providers

When using realtime voice providers like `OpenAIRealtimeVoice`, the `speak()` method behaves differently:

- Instead of returning an audio stream, it emits a 'speaking' event with the audio data
- You need to register an event listener to receive the audio chunks

```typescript
import { OpenAIRealtimeVoice } from "@mastra/voice-openai-realtime";
import Speaker from "@mastra/node-speaker";

const speaker = new Speaker({
  sampleRate: 24100,  // Audio sample rate in Hz - standard for high-quality audio on MacBook Pro
  channels: 1,        // Mono audio output (as opposed to stereo which would be 2)
  bitDepth: 16,       // Bit depth for audio quality - CD quality standard (16-bit resolution)
});

const voice = new OpenAIRealtimeVoice();
await voice.connect();
// Register event listener for audio chunks
voice.on("speaker", (stream) => {
  // Handle audio chunk (e.g., play it or save it)
  stream.pipe(speaker)
});
// This will emit 'speaking' events instead of returning a stream
await voice.speak("Hello, this is realtime speech!");
```


## Using with CompositeVoice

When using `CompositeVoice`, the `speak()` method delegates to the configured speaking provider:

```typescript
import { CompositeVoice } from "@mastra/core/voice";
import { OpenAIVoice } from "@mastra/voice-openai";
import { PlayAIVoice } from "@mastra/voice-playai";
const voice = new CompositeVoice({
  speakProvider: new PlayAIVoice(),
  listenProvider: new OpenAIVoice(),
});
// This will use the PlayAIVoice provider
const audioStream = await voice.speak("Hello, world!");
```

## Notes

- The behavior of `speak()` may vary slightly between providers, but all implementations follow the same basic interface.
- When using a realtime voice provider, the method might not return an audio stream directly but instead emit a 'speaking' event.
- If a text stream is provided as input, the provider will typically convert it to a string before processing.
- The audio format of the returned stream depends on the provider. Common formats include MP3, WAV, and OGG.
- For best performance, consider closing or ending the audio stream when you're done with it.
